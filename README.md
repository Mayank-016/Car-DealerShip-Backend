# Car-DealerShip-Backend
## Car Dealership Management System (Incomplete)

This repository contains the code for a Car Dealership Management System API built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. It provides various endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users, dealerships, cars, and deals.

Please note that this project is **not complete** and serves as a starting point for developing a car dealership management system. It covers basic user authentication and some API endpoints, but additional features and functionalities are yet to be implemented.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Users, dealerships, and administrators can log in using their email and password to obtain a JSON Web Token for authentication.

- **User Endpoints**: Users can view available cars, search for dealerships, view deals on certain cars, and more.

- **Dealership Endpoints**: Dealerships can manage their car inventory, view sold vehicles, add deals, and more.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mayank-016/car-dealership-management.git
cd car-dealership-management
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```

```

3. Set up MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB and update the `uri` variable in `app.js` with the appropriate connection string.

### Usage

1. Start the server:

```
npm start
```
